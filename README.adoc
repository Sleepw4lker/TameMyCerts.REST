= The "bring AD CS to REST" API

A simple, yet powerful REST API for submitting certificates to one or more Microsoft link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/certificate-services[Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)^] certification authorities, written in C#.

== Introduction

The API allows for requesting certificates from systems that are not joined to the same Active Directory domain as the certification authorities (or not joined to any domain at all). It can serve any client operating system that is capable of submitting a REST API call. It converts certificate requests submitted via REST to the DCOM protocol. Therefore it is perfectly suited for certificate issuance scenarios from Linux, BSD, cloud services and the like. It can also be used to connect cloud-native certificate management solutions (like link:https://cert-manager.io/[cert-manager^]) or open source implementations of the ACME protocol (like link:https://github.com/dvtirol/serles-acme[Serles^]) to a Microsoft certificate authority with this API.

== Installing

Please note that the API is still in development. Binary packages will be available on the releases page as soon as it will reach release-stadium.

=== Security and Implementation considerations

You don't need a service account. The integrated IIS application pool identity is sufficient if you use HTTP basic authentication (link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617[RFC 7617^]). The chosen service account must have the SeImpersonatePrivilege ("Impersonate a client after authentication") on the API web server, which by default is granted through membership of the local IIS_IUSRS security group.

Submitted certificate requests appear on the certificate authority under the security context of the Active Directory user who submitted them via the API. So permissions are handled on the CA/Template level, exactly as you would do with DCOM. You may want to combine the API with the link:https://github.com/Sleepw4lker/TameMyCerts[TameMyCerts policy module^] on your certification authorities to be able to strictly restrict requested certificate content.

I suggest using the API with link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/security/basic-authentication[Basic Authentication^]. Windows Authentication (NTLM/Kerberos) and Client Certificate Authentication work as well, but I advise against these because you will need Kerberos Delegation which can be a very dangerous topic that should be used with extreme caution.

As the API requires authentication, it should only be used over HTTPS.

You should easily be able to implement a high-availability setup behind a loadbalancer, as all API calls are stateless.

The API web server must be a domain member and able to contact both Active Directory Domain Controllers as well as each certificate authority. For API to CA communications, you must allow ports 135/tcp and 49152-65535/tcp. 

=== Supported Operating Systems and Prerequisites

The API was successfully tested with the following operating systems:

* Windows Server 2022
* Windows Server 2019

It *should* work as well with the following ones but this is yet to be tested.

* Windows Server 2016
* Windows Server 2012 R2

Older operating systems are not supported.

For Windows Server 2016 and below, link:https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/microsoft-net-framework-4-7-2-offline-installer-for-windows-05a72734-2127-a15d-50cf-daf56d5faec2[.NET Framework 4.7.2^] must be installed.

=== Installing IIS

Install IIS with the following basic feature set.

....
Add-WindowsFeature -Name Web-Server,Web-Asp-Net45,Web-Basic-Auth,Web-Filtering -IncludeManagementTools
....

Ensure you have a SSL certificate installed and require SSL on the web site you plan to install the API onto.

=== Installing AdcsToRest

Simply copy the files into the designated Web Root. No application configuration required.

=== Configuring IIS

Configure your SSL Binding and ensure the "Require SSL" configuration parameter is set.

For Basic Authentication, on the web site, in authentication settings, do the following:

* Disable anonymous Authentication
* Enable Basic Authentication
* Configure your Default Domain for Basic Authentication

== Using the API

NOTE: The API incorporates Swagger for automated documentation of the API operations. You can reach it under the /swagger directory, which is the default directory when you access it via browser. Consult this resource for detailled information. You can find the API specification link:v1.json[here].

|===
|Operation |Description

|GET /v1/CertificateAuthority
|Retrieves a collection of all available certificate authorities.

|GET /v1/CertificateAuthority/{caName}
|Retrieves details for a certificate authority.

|GET /v1/CertificateAuthority/{caName}/{requestId}
|Retrieves an issued certificate from a certificate authority.

|POST /v1/CertificateAuthority/{caName}
|Submits a certificate signing request to a certificate authority.

|===

== Troubleshooting

For simplicity, the API does not log to any text file or the Windows Event Log. Errors that may occur on the CA level are forwarded to the requesting client (as it would be the case if you'd use DCOM directly).

== Building

Call the supplied build script from the Visual Studio Developer command prompt:
